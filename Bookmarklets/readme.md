Here are some useful bookmarkets that I have collected for working with Dyanmics CRM (tested with CRM 2016)
The best way to use these is to:
1. Open the following page:https://rawgit.com/rajrao/CRM-Tools/master/Bookmarklets/bookmark.htm (source: https://github.com/rajrao/CRM-Tools/blob/master/Bookmarklets/bookmark.htm).
2. Drag each of the links onto your bookmarks bar in your browser.
3. Browse to CRM and click on the links and watch them do their magic!
