Here are some useful bookmarkets that I have collected for working with Dyanmics CRM (tested with CRM 2016)

1. Download the files from: https://github.com/rajrao/CRM-Tools (you need just the folder CrmDev).
2. Open the following location via Windows Explorer: %userprofile%\Favorites\Links
3. Copy the folder CrmDev into the folder opened in (2).
You will now have access to the bookmarks in IE.

**Alternatively**, you can use the following html and use the import functionality in your favorite browser to get these links.
