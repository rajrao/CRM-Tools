This folder contains examples of the javascript that the Dynamics Business Rule UI editor generates. I found this javascript to be instructive as it shows how Microsoft likes to write their javascript.

There are 2 examples in here:
1. A simple business rule: [SampleGeneratedJavascript.js](https://github.com/rajrao/CRM-Tools/blob/master/JavaScript/BusinessRules/SampleGeneratedJavascript.js)
2. A complex business rule: [Complex Business Rule.js](https://github.com/rajrao/CRM-Tools/blob/master/JavaScript/BusinessRules/Complex%20Business%20Rule.js)

You can see what the complex business rule look like:
